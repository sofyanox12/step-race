# Step Race ðŸŽ²

A game that uses the [Snakes and Ladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders) mechanism where your player **rolls the dice to step forward** until reaches the 50th tile.
The only difference is that the layout of this game uses horizontal planes, traps, and some powerups rather than snakes and ladders for random tile events.

## Misc

The layer uses Java FX which gives us a lot of UI options to use.
The Engine is made using a thread that is integrated into Java FX (which needs to override the limitation of non-Java FX
libraries usage).

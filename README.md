# STEP RACE GAME (ALPHA-VERSION)
---

This is a mini-game that implements The Snakes and Ladders mechanism where your player rolls the dice to step forward until finished.

The only difference is that the layout of this game uses horizontal planes, traps and some powerups rather than using snakes and ladders for random events.

The reason why we use Java

- It's Object Oriented-based
- Easy to Learn for Compiled Resources
- Of Course, for our end-semester's project âœ¨

Features :

- Dice movement-based game.
- 3 Kinds of Power UPs with each having their ability.
- Traps, Power-ups, and Object tiles are randomized.
- Animated idling and movement on character.
- Some bugs that we don't have time to fix it.

Enjoy!

## Misc

This game implemented Java FX libraries which gives us a lot of UI node options to use.
Engine using thread with Java FX implemented methods to override the limitation of non-Java FX
libraries usage (in this case: Thread objects).

- Special Thanks to our adjunct professors (Mr Max & Ms Cecillia) for sparing their limited time and sweat to give this invaluable subject (Java Object Oriented-Programming).
